# Network Reliability Mechanisms over UDP

## COMP 7005 - Applied Computer Science, Network Security Applications Development Option Jan 2024

This project is a pairs assignment for COMP 7005. If you intend to work alone, you must obtain the instructor's permission.

### Objective
- Understand and implement reliability mechanisms over an unreliable protocol (UDP) akin to TCP's.
- Explore the challenges and solutions in ensuring data integrity and delivery in network communication.

### Learning Outcomes
- Gain practical experience in socket programming with UDP.
- Understand the principles behind TCPâ€™s reliability and how to implement similar mechanisms in UDP.
- Develop skills in creating robust network applications that can handle network unreliability.
- Learn to use command-line arguments for dynamic application configuration.
- Analyze and interpret network behavior through data visualization.

### Components
#### Client
- Sends data to the server via the proxy.
- Must handle acknowledgments and timeouts.

#### Server
- Receives data from the client, processes it, and possibly sends a response.
- Must handle duplicate and out-of-order packets.

#### Proxy
- Simulates network unreliability.
- Introduces packet loss and delays according to specified probabilities and ranges.
  - % chance to drop packets coming from the client
  - % chance to drop packets coming from the server
  - % chance to drop delay coming from the client
  - % chance to drop delay coming from the server
  - Range (min/max) milliseconds to delay if a packet is delayed coming from the client
  - Range (min/max) milliseconds to delay if a packet is delayed coming from the server

### Functionality
- Implement reliability features such as packet acknowledgment, retransmission on timeout, and sequence numbering to handle duplicates and ordering.
- Use command-line arguments to configure all parameters (e.g., IP addresses, ports, packet drop probability, delay range, etc.).
- Bonus: real-time graph.

### Visualization
- Generate graphs to visualize packets sent, received, retransmitted packets, etc., for both the client and server.

### Documentation
#### Design Document
- Describe the architecture, components, and algorithms used to ensure UDP reliability.

#### Testing Document
- Detail the testing methodology, scenarios, and outcomes.
- Include how the proxy's behavior was varied, how the system was observed, and how it responded to different challenges.

### Constraints
- Follow the guidelines.
- Ensure all components are robust against network unreliability scenarios.
- Dynamic configuration through command-line arguments is mandatory; hardcoding of parameters is not allowed.
- Both students must participate equally in all aspects of the project, or you may fail.

### Resources
- Provide references to UDP and TCP documentation, socket programming tutorials, and any libraries or tools used for graph generation.
